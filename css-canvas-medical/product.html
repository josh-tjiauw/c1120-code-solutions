          Canvas creates a shared understanding of patient care across clinicians,<br>

          You don't have to click a dozen times to order a flu shot or<br>
          bounce around five windows to discover the last blood<br>
          count. Canvas pulls everything you need directly into your<br>
          note, so you never have to leave it. And because Canvas<br>
          learns from every interaction, it gets smarter with every<br>
          patient you see.

          the past 3 months? Which of my patients are on potentially unsafe<br>
          levels of opioids according to the most recent guidelines? That<br>
          doesn't seem like a lot to ask and those are tremendously important<br>
