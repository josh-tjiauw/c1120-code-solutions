  <h1>Tribonacci Sequence</h1>

  <h2>Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.</h2>

  <p>
  As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, <br>
  but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next.
  </p>

  <p>
    Well, you may have guessed it by now, but to be clear: you need to create a fibonacci function that given a signature <br>
    array/list, returns the first n elements - signature included of the so seeded sequence.<br><br>

    Signature will always contain 3 numbers; n will always be a non-negative number; if n == 0, then return an empty array<br>
    (except in C return NULL) and be ready for anything else which is not clearly specified<br><br>

    Examples: <br>
    [1, 1 ,1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, ...] <br>
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, ...]
  </p>
